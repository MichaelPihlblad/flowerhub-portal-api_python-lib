    # Note: This workflow currently uses the PYPI_API_TOKEN secret for authentication.
    # To enable PyPI Trusted Publishing (recommended):
    # 1. Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/
    # 2. Add a new publisher for this repository
    # 3. Remove the PYPI_API_TOKEN secret and the env block below
    # 4. Trusted publishing will use OIDC authentication automatically
